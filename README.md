<h2>🗺️Project Description</h2>
<p></p>This business intelligence portfolio project is based on my coursework through the Maven Analytics Microsoft Power BI Desktop course utilizing Microsoft's popular <i>AdventureWorks</i> ecommerce database.</p>

<p>The global manufacturing company, Adventure Works Cycle has hired me as a Business Intelligence Analyst. Adventure Works Cycle needs a way to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. Using raw csv files, the company needs their data transformed, analyzed and turned into an interactive report that visualizes the insights.</p>
